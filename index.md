### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because I liked creating the guessing game with if statements. I enjoyed learning about if-else statements, and I liked the challenge of figuring out how to use them to make the guessing game work.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I liked calculating the difference between dates. I enjoyed writing the functions to calculate the number of days between dates, and it was interesting to learn how the difference between Julian days is calculated.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I enjoyed making a gradient. It was interesting to see how GraphicsMajick worked because it was the main function used to make the gradient. I also enjoyed working with the RGB color scheme.
